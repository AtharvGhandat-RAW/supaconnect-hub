    <h1 class="chapter-name">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h1>

    <p>
        It gives me great pleasure to present the project report on <strong>"Attendro"</strong>. The successful completion of this project would not have been possible without the guidance and support of many respected individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
        First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my project guide, <strong>[Name of Guide]</strong>. Their deep knowledge of IoT and patience in explaining the concepts helped me navigate through the technical challenges of working with the ESP32 and fingerprint sensors. Whenever I was stuck with a bug or a hardware issue, their advice pointed me in the right direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am also sincerely thankful to <strong>[Name of HOD]</strong>, Head of the Department, for providing us with the necessary laboratory facilities and encouragement to take up this project.
    </p>

    <p>
        I extend my thanks to our Principal, <strong>[Name of Principal]</strong>, for providing an academic environment that fosters innovation and practical learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would also like to mention the support of the non-teaching staff and lab assistants who helped arrange the necessary components and tools for our hardware assembly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Last but not least, I thank my parents and friends. Their constant encouragement and moral support kept me motivated, especially during the long nights of coding and testing.
