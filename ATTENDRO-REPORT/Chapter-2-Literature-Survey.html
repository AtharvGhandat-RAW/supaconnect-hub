            <h1 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 2<br>LITERATURE SURVEY</h1>

            <h2 class="section-heading">2.1 Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                A comprehensive literature survey is the cornerstone of any technical project, ensuring that the proposed solution is grounded in existing knowledge while addressing genuine deficiencies in current technologies. For the "Attendro" project, this survey explores the historical and technological trajectory of attendance management systems in educational institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Attendance monitoring is not merely an administrative formality; it is a critical metric for student engagement and academic integrity. Traditionally, this process has been manual, consuming valuable instructional time and remaining susceptible to manipulation. As institutions move towards "Smart Campus" paradigms, the demand for automated, secure, and real-time attendance solutions has surged. This chapter analyzes the evolution of these systems, examines the specific technologies underpinning modern IoT solutions (such as the ESP32 microcontroller and optical biometrics), and critiques prior academic implementations. By identifying the limitations of existing manual, RFID, and fixed biometric systems, we define the precise "Research Gap" that Attendro aims to fill—specifically, the need for a system that combines the high security of biometrics with the portability and context-awareness required for dynamic classroom environments.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">2.2 Evolution of Attendance Systems</h2>
            <p>
                The progression of attendance tracking technology can be characterized by a constant struggle between two opposing factors: <strong>Ease of Use</strong> and <strong>Security (Integrity)</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2.1 Manual Systems (Paper-based)</h3>
            <p>
                The most primitive form of attendance tracking, the manual register, relies on the lecturer calling out names or passing a sheet for signatures.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Physical paper logs signed by students.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Zero implementation cost; no technical infrastructure required.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Highly inefficient, consuming 5-10 minutes of class time. It is fraught with "proxy" attendance (one student signing for another) and results in data silos where attendance records are physically stored in binders, making aggregate analysis or real-time alerts impossible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2.2 RFID and ID Card-based Systems</h3>
            <p>
                To address the time inefficiency of manual systems, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was widely adopted.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Students tap a passive RFID tag (ID card) against a reader.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely fast (milliseconds per student).</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> The "Buddy Punching" problem. RFID systems verify the presence of the <em>card</em>, not the <em>student</em>. It is trivial for a truant student to hand their card to a peer. Thus, while efficiency increased, integrity remained compromised.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2.3 Fixed Biometric Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Biometrics (fingerprint/face recognition) were introduced to solve the identity crisis of RFID.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Wall-mounted scanners (often at the entrance) usually based on optical fingerprint sensors or facial recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> High integrity; practically eliminates proxy attendance.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> These systems introduced new bottlenecks. "Queuing" at a single door scanner creates congestion. Furthermore, fixed systems often lack "Session Context"—they record that a student entered the building at 09:00, but cannot easily distinguish if they attended the specific lecture in Room 302 or wandered the hallways. Installation is also expensive and rigid.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2.4 Mobile and QR-based Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Modern attempts leverage the student's own smartphone (BYOD - Bring Your Own Device).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Apps that use GPS/Bluetooth or scan a QR code projected by the teacher.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Zero hardware cost for the institution; highly portable.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Paradoxically, this returned to low integrity. GPS is imprecise indoors (room-level accuracy is difficult), and QR codes can be photographed and shared via messaging apps to students outside the class, enabling "Remote Proxy."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">2.3 Review of Related Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                To design a solution that transcends these limitations, we examined the core technologies available for IoT development.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.3.1 IoT in Education: The ESP32 Platform</h3>
            <p>
                 While early smart systems utilized the Arduino Uno (ATmega328P), modern localized attendance systems require inherent connectivity. The <strong>ESP32-WROOM-32</strong> has emerged as the standard for such applications. Its dual-core processor (running at up to 240 MHz) provides sufficient power to handle biometric image processing and encrypted communication simultaneously. Crucially, its integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities allow the device to act as a standalone web server or cloud client, removing the need for auxiliary shields or wiring. This enables the creation of truly "portable" hardware.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.3.2 Biometric Sensing: Optical vs. Capacitive</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Optical Sensors (e.g., R307, R305):</strong> These capture an image of the fingerprint ridges using visible light and a prism. They are physically durable and cost-effective but can struggle with direct sunlight or dirty fingers. <br>
                <strong>Capacitive Sensors:</strong> Common in smartphones, these use electrical current to map the finger. While faster, the larger surface area required for standalone units makes them prohibitively expensive for student projects. <br>
                <em>Conclusion:</em> The R307 Optical Sensor offers the optimal balance of surface area, library support (Adafruit Fingerprint Library), and durability for a device that will be passed around a classroom.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.3.3 Cloud Synchronization and Data Handling</h3>
            <p>
                Legacy embedded systems often stored data on local SD cards, requiring physical retrieval and manual Excel compilation—a process known as "Sneaker-net." Modern IoT architecture demands real-time synchronization. Services like Google Firebase and Supabase (PostgreSQL) offer RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections that allow the ESP32 to push attendance data instantly. This shift allows for "Live Dashboards" where administrators can see attendance as it happens, a feature absent in SD-card based solutions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">2.4 Literature Review Case Studies</h2>
            <p>
                We analyzed several proposed systems in academic literature to understand common pitfalls.

            <h2 class="section-heading">2.5 Research Gap and Problem Definition</h2>
            <p>
                The literature reveals a distinct "Quadrant Gap." Existing systems tend to occupy one of two extremes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Portability / Low Security:</strong> Mobile Apps, QR codes, Manual Sheets.</li>
                <li><strong>High Security / Low Portability:</strong> Wall-mounted Biometrics, Iris Scanners.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>The Missing Link:</strong> There is a lack of systems that are <em>both</em> highly secure (Biometric) and highly portable (can be handed to students in their seats), while maintaining "Session Awareness" (knowing <em>which</em> class is currently happening).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
                <em>"Current attendance systems force a compromise between data integrity and operational efficiency. There exists no unified, low-cost framework that provides the irrefutable identity verification of biometrics while accommodating the dynamic, session-based nature of academic schedules without creating physical bottlenecks."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This gap defines the scope for <strong>Attendro</strong>: A portable, session-aware, biometric IoT device.
